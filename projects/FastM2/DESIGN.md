# FastM2 — a single-window Modula-2 IDE

A small, fast, single-window IDE for Modula-2 in the spirit of Turbo Pascal /
QuickBASIC — a menu bar, a full-screen code editor, an output pane, and a status
line — but rendered as a modern GUI (Direct2D, anti-aliased, mouse-aware) rather
than VGA text mode. **FastM2 is itself written in Modula-2**, on the same
WindowsModula2 stack it edits, and it drives the `newm2` toolchain to compile and
run what you type.

## Why this stack

Everything the IDE needs already exists in the library, so FastM2 is mostly glue:

| Need | Provided by |
|------|-------------|
| Window + message loop + window-proc callback | `WinShell` |
| Character cell grid, menus, status bar, drop-downs, event queue | `Terminal` |
| Direct2D/DirectWrite rendering of the grid (crisp, no GDI) | `TermRender` |
| Document buffer — O(log n) insert/delete | `TextRope` |
| Compile/run the edited program, capture its output | `RunProg.PerformCommand` (cmd.exe `/C`, output redirected to a temp file) |

The Terminal cell grid is the right model for a code editor (monospace, per-cell
colour = trivial syntax highlighting) and already carries the menu/status furniture;
TermRender makes it look modern. So FastM2 is "more of a GUI" via Direct2D rendering
+ mouse + drop-down menus, while keeping the text-mode IDE's speed and clarity.

## Layout (single window)

```

+------------------------------------------------------------------+

|                                                                |      program output)

## Colour scheme (Turbo-Pascal-ish)

- Editor: bright text on **navy**; keywords **white/bold**, comments **grey**,
  strings **yellow**, numbers **aqua**, the rest **silver**.
- Menu bar / status bar: black on **grey**, highlighted item black on **cyan**.
- Output pane: light grey on near-black; error lines in **red**.
- Cursor: reverse video.

## Features (v1)

- **Editor** — type / Enter / Backspace / Del, arrows / Home / End / PgUp / PgDn,
  vertical + horizontal scroll, a line-number gutter. Buffer is a `TextRope`.
- **Selection + clipboard** — Shift+move or mouse click/drag selects (highlighted,
  spans line breaks); Cut / Copy / Paste / Select-All over the Windows clipboard
  (a `Clipboard` runtime module, CF_UNICODETEXT); typing/paste replaces the selection.
- **Search** — Find (case-insensitive, wraps), Replace (replace-all), and Goto-line,
  all via a status-line prompt; Ctrl+F / Ctrl+R / Ctrl+G.
- **Source > Format** — a structural re-indenter (two spaces per nesting level from
  the M2 block keywords; not a full pretty-printer).
- **Recent files** — an MRU list persisted to `fastm2_recent.txt`, shown in File.
- **Syntax highlighting** — a small Modula-2 tokeniser colours each visible line
  (keywords, `(* *)` comments incl. multi-line, `"…"`/`'…'` strings, numbers).
- **File** — New, Open…, Save, Save As… via the classic Windows common dialogs
  (a `Dialogs` runtime module over comdlg32); a "discard unsaved changes?" confirm;
  modified-flag and current file name in the status bar.
- **Compile (F9)** — save, run `newm2 build <file> --library <lib> > out 2>&1`,
  show the captured output; on a `file:line: error`, move the cursor to that line.
- **Run (F5)** — compile, and if clean run the program and show its output (GUI
  programs are launched detached).
- **Menus** — File / Edit / Search / Source / Build / Help drop-downs via `Terminal`'s
  `HandleKey`/`NextEvent` state machine, opened with **F10**, an **Alt** accelerator,
  or the **mouse** (new `Terminal.MenuBarHit`/`MenuPopupHit` hit-testing), plus the
  F-key + Ctrl-key shortcuts.
- **Resizing + split** — the window resizes without scaling: on `WM_SIZE` the grid
  is re-`Init`-ed to fit the client area at native cell size (via `TermRender.Resize`,
  which resizes the Direct2D target in place), so the text area grows/shrinks; layout
  is recomputed from the live grid. The editor/output split is draggable (grab the
  Output bar).
- **Status bar** — file name + modified flag, `Ln/Col`, key hints; doubles as the
  Find/Replace/Goto input line.

## Module structure

- `FastM2.mod` — the application: window + handler + main loop, editor state
  (TextRope + cursor + scroll), the syntax tokeniser, the output pane, and the
  compile/run glue. Built on `WinShell`/`Terminal`/`TermRender`/`TextRope`/`RunProg`.
- (Later) split the tokeniser and the editor core into their own modules if it grows.

## Compile/run mechanism

1. Write the buffer to `fastm2_work.mod`.
2. `RunProg.PerformCommand("<newm2> build fastm2_work.mod --library <lib> > fastm2_out.txt 2>&1", SyncExec, status)`.
3. Read `fastm2_out.txt` into the output pane; if `status # 0`, scan it for the
   first `…:<line>: error` and jump the editor there.
4. Run = the same with `run`, or launch the built `.exe` detached for GUI programs.

The compiler path + library path are CONSTs at the top (default `target\debug\
newm2-driver.exe` and the repo `library`), so FastM2 is run from the repo root for now.

## Performance: the line cache

A repaint must answer two *independent* questions about the top visible line, and
the naive code answered both by rescanning from offset 0 — making a repaint
~O(lines · document):

- **Positioning** (line number → byte offset). Solved eagerly: a `gLineStart[]`
  index rebuilt on every edit by one newline scan. The cursor needs exact
  line↔offset the instant after an edit, so this is computed synchronously;
  `PosToLineCol` is then a binary search, `LineStart`/`LineLen` are O(1).
- **Lexer entry-state** (the highlighter's state entering the line). This depends
  on *arbitrarily distant* context — one unterminated `(*` ten thousand lines up
  recolours everything below — so it cannot be cheap, correct, and stateless at
  once. We keep it correct by caching it per line. The whole cross-line state is a
  single `CARDINAL` (comment-nesting depth), because Modula-2 strings close at EOL.
  It's filled *lazily*: a high-water mark `gLexValid` grows downward as you scroll
  (append-only, matching the top-down render), and an edit truncates it to the
  edited line; the suffix re-derives on the next paint.

Net: a repaint is O(visible), cursor moves are O(log lines), and an edit is the
one newline rescan (the positioning half — a newline-weighted rope would make that
O(log n) too, and the lexer half could add convergence-stopping; both are future
work). The cache algorithm is cross-checked against from-scratch scans by a
headless test (positioning, multi-line/nested comments, `(*` in strings, lazy ==
eager, and post-edit consistency).

## Not yet (kept simple, well-trodden ground)

Multiple files/tabs, undo/redo, project files, a debugger, and a strings/comments-
aware formatter. The editor buffer is a rope, so undo is cheap to add next.
